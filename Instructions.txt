To run a function run the below commands on the command line:

python main.py [function name] [arguments]


Functions:

record {duration=RECORD_DURATION} {name=[y/m/d hr/min/sec]} {delay=RECORD_DELAY}
  Basic Recording function that records all the inputs and returns a new file.
  Doesn't allow files with duplucate names
  @param args: the input parameters on the command line in a list
    - duration: float representing the duration of the recording
    - name: string representing the of the file (without .txt appeneded)
    - delay: float representing the time to wait before recording
        takes the form of "delay=[float]"
  @SideEffect: Creates a File which the record function has written to.


record_serial {duration=RECORD_DURATION} {name=[y/m/d hr/min/sec]} {delay=RECORD_DELAY}
  Similar to record, except it serializes the output instead, turing it into
  readable file object which allows us to extract the original data structures.


update_settings {setting_name} {setting_value}
  Script that updates the settings within the .settings file.
  @param args: the input parameters on the command line in a list
    - setting_name: The name of the setting default we're trying to overwrite
    - setting_value: The new value of said parameter


restore_defaults
  A function that simply restores the original default settings.


show_defaults
  Shows all the current default settings.


perform

NOTE: Our script doesn't support hotkeys just yet, we need to figure that out
