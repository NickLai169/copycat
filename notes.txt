Functionality:
- We want it to be able to record mouse and keyboard movements, and replicate it
  - Both either in regular speed or hastened speed
- We want it to have the functionality of verifying whether the current screen is
  looking as it should.

<<<<<< commit d36118d00acd3ab042ba29ab1f27ec682a2f2ca0 >>>>>>

I will now copy and paste the tester file from LeagueBot into this project, that
file should have the basic pynput framework established.

- LeagueBot tester imported

Note: All functions should take at least 1 argument, even if that argument is
expected to be an empty list of arguments

- created functions.py which should house all the functions
- set up the basic main function framework
- Figured out how to set a timer
- Completed the timing system
- Completed the variable assignments of duration and name

Ready to begin writing and recording to a new file.

<<<<<< commit 068e8025ae66074b4b3a7bfb2088f7d5fc3cc31f >>>>>>

I am ready to begin writing and recording to new files

Note: The mouse position and whatnot are recorded as ratios to ensure that the
recordings work on screens of the same aspect ratio, but different dimensions.

I noticed there was a problem with my retString approach, therefore I am going
to try to revert back to the write-as-you-go strategy.

<<<<<< commit f1c9ed9c5036f15d3e1d0e953423d1d6132f9e6a >>>>>>

Write-as-you-go strategy adopted, seems to be going smoothly so far

- Implemented all mouse_listener functions
- Implemented all key_listener functions
- I think record() funcion is complete

Now we should create a "perform" function that analyses and replicates a recording
