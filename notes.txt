Functionality:
- We want it to be able to record mouse and keyboard movements, and replicate it
  - Both either in regular speed or hastened speed
- We want it to have the functionality of verifying whether the current screen is
  looking as it should.

<<<<<< commit d36118d00acd3ab042ba29ab1f27ec682a2f2ca0 >>>>>>

I will now copy and paste the tester file from LeagueBot into this project, that
file should have the basic pynput framework established.

- LeagueBot tester imported

Note: All functions should take at least 1 argument, even if that argument is
expected to be an empty list of arguments

- created functions.py which should house all the functions
- set up the basic main function framework
- Figured out how to set a timer
- Completed the timing system
- Completed the variable assignments of duration and name

Ready to begin writing and recording to a new file.
